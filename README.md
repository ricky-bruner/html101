# html101
## Simple intro to HTML

This is the first HTML assignment at NSS. It was to be a simple exercise to very quickly move through HTML and CSS and on to Javascript. There is no JS present in this project.

## Also includes basic CSS

The CSS in this particular project got a bit wild over what was really asked for or expected. I have a great deal of difficulty breaking out of styling. I believe I've learned that I'm a very visual coder, and I love assessing what I have and thinking of ways to beautify it. I really got carried away here with this project.

### Self-Challenges:

I wanted to incorporate a bit of everything I knew prior to NSS, gleamed from Jumpstart and a few months of treehouse and side pet-projects.

On the HTML side, things are faily basic. Before completion, I would like to revisit and make everything MORE semantic.

I also wished to play around with SVG files. I found some great ones to use, and have changed the colors and size to make them applicable. I found this process to be really rewarding!

As I find time between grappling with the soul-crushing reality that is understanding Javascript, I'd like to return to this project to clean it up. I'd also like to make it just a general Harry Potter page full of my favorite aspects of the Wizarding World. Instead of each professor having a singular page, I'd like the pages to be students, staff, knight bus, hogwarts express, etc.

### Adding Javascript 

Initial ideas: a button on the students page that lets you elect your house of choice and change the styles to reflect those houses, possibly even replace the trio with Luna, Cho, Myrtle for Ravenclaw, and of course Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle for Slytherin and so on (sorry Hufflepuff!).

Additionally, I'd like everything to be on a single index, and the content to remain hidden until selected for view.

I can think of a few things id like to figure out how to animate as well, but these are all for now.
